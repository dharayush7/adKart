## Usage

1. **Access the Website:**

   Visit `http://localhost:8000` or cloudflare url in your web browser to view and interact with ADKart.

2. **Add products** 
There no product is display in `/shop` page. To add product go `/admin` page and log in with the admin credentials. In products section add some products.

2. **Testing Payment Integration:**

   Use PayU's test credentials and sandbox environment to test payment functionality.

- some test credentials of PayU:
  - Card No. : 5123456789012346, Expiry : 05/25, CVV : 123, OTP : 123456 
  - Card No. : 4012001037141112, Expiry : 05/25, CVV : 123, OTP : 123456 
  - Card No. : 5118-7000-0000-0003, Expiry : 05/25, CVV : 123, OTP : 123456 

For more credentials Visit -  https://docs.payu.in/docs/test-cards-upi-id-and-wallets

3. **Order Update push**:

In the django admin go to `Order Updates` and add new. 
provide the order no and desc and save. Now track the order and hare new order updates are available.

4. **Important Note**: 
When a order placed few oreder updates are autometically pushed. When payment is initiate a order updates of this pushed the database. After successfull payment there are two order updates are pushed which are that payment success and order placed. If transaction are failed, in order updates also be changed to payment failed and order cancelled. 

## Convert PayU Test Environment to live

### 1. Setup Credetials like Api key and Salt:
- Navigate to `/shop/payments/payU.py`
- In `merchant_key` function replace MID and SALT to live Credetials

  ```bash
  def merchant_key():
    MID = "JPM7Fg" # merchant_key
    SALT = "TuxqAugd" # salt
    credes = {
        "key":MID,
        "salt": SALT
    }
    return credes
  ``` 
### 2. Set Production Environment
- Navigate to `/shop/templates/payu.html`
- Replace the action to `https://secure.payu.in/_payment` 

 ```bash
 <form id="frm" action="https://secure.payu.in/_payment" method="post">
      <input type="hidden" name="key" value="{{ key }}" />
      <input type="hidden" name="txnid" value="{{ txnid }}" />
      <input type="hidden" name="productinfo" value="{{ productinfo }}" />
      <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="{{ amount }}" />
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="{{ email }}" />
      <input type="hidden" name="firstname" value="{{ firstname }}" />
      <input
        type="hidden"
        name="surl"
        value="{{ surl }}"
      />
      <input
        type="hidden"
        name="furl"
        value="{{ furl }}"
      />
      <input type="hidden" name="phone" value="{{ phone }}" />
      <input
        type="hidden"
        name="hash"
        value="{{ hash }}"
      />
    </form>
 ```

 - Now its ready to go


## Troubleshooting


- **Database Issues:** Ensure migrations have been applied and default data is loaded.
- **Payment Processing Errors:** Verify PayU credentials and Cloudflare Tunnel configuration.
