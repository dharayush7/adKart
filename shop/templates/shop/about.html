        <p class="text-light">ADCart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, and
          incorporated in Singapore as a
          private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other
          product
          categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products. </p>

        <p class="text-light">
          The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal. As of FY23, ADCart held
          a 48%
          market share in the Indian e-commerce industry. ADCart has a dominant position in the apparel segment,
          bolstered by
          its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics
          and mobile
          phones.</p>
